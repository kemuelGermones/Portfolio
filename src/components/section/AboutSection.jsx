                    Hello! My name is Kemuel, I am a self-taught developer                     
                    for over a year now. Since discovering the field of software development,                    
                    I've always been interested in pursuing it, but I am also hesitant since                     
                    my course doesn't align with this field. After countless YouTube motivational                    
                    videos, I've decided to self learn all the necessary tools and technologies                    
                    to develop a web application but it isn't easy.
                </p>
                <p data-aos="fade-up">
                    I'd thought that I could be a full stack developer for three 
                    months but I was slapped by reality. So I decided to take my 
                    time and learn at my own pace. After a year of ups and downs of 
                    learning, I've managed to build full stack web applications and I've 
                    realized that even one year isn't enough, life-long learning does.

                    Here are a few technologies Iâ€™ve learned:
